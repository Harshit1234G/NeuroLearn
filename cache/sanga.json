  "tutor_notes": "# Review of the questions you missed — step-by-step help\n\nYou're doing well with the basics. Below I restate each wrong question in simple words, show your answer vs. the correct one, explain the mistake, and solve it carefully step by step so you can see exactly where things go wrong.\n\n---\n\n## Question A — Simple restatement\n90 is added to 60% of a number \\(X\\). The result is divided by 12 and that quotient is 50. What is \\(X\\)?\n\n- Your answer: 750  \n- Correct answer: 850\n\n### Why your answer is incorrect\nYou likely made a slip when converting percent to decimal or when solving the final division. This problem needs you to convert 60% to \\(0.6\\) and solve a linear equation. A small arithmetic mistake (like dividing by 0.6 incorrectly) would give a wrong result.\n\n### Step-by-step solution\n1. Translate the sentence into an equation.\n\n   \"90 is added to 60% of \\(X\\)\" means \\(0.6X + 90\\).  \n   That result divided by 12 equals 50, so:\n   $$\n   \\frac{0.6X + 90}{12} = 50\n   $$\n\n2. Multiply both sides by 12 to remove the denominator:\n   $$\n   0.6X + 90 = 50 \\times 12 = 600\n   $$\n\n3. Subtract 90 from both sides:\n   $$\n   0.6X = 600 - 90 = 510\n   $$\n\n4. Divide both sides by 0.6 to find \\(X\\):\n   $$\n   X = \\frac{510}{0.6} = 850\n   $$\n\nFinal answer: \\(X = 850\\). This matches option (c).\n\n---\n\n## Question B — Simple restatement\nA student took an exam with 4 subjects. Each subject has the same maximum marks (80 marks each). He scored overall 80%. In the first three subjects he scored 75%, 60%, and 90% respectively (these percentages are of the 80 marks). How many marks did he get in the fourth subject (out of 80)?\n\n- Your answer: 60  \n- Correct answer: 76\n\n### Why your answer is incorrect\nYou may have mistaken the question as asking for one of the already-given subject marks, or you didn't compute the total required marks from the overall percentage before subtracting the three known scores.\n\n### Step-by-step solution\n1. Maximum marks per subject = 80. Total maximum for 4 subjects:\n   $$\n   4 \\times 80 = 320\n   $$\n\n2. He scored 80% overall, so total marks obtained:\n   $$\n   0.8 \\times 320 = 256\n   $$\n\n3. Compute marks in the first three subjects:\n   - First subject: \\(75\\% \\) of 80 = \\(0.75 \\times 80 = 60\\)\n   - Second subject: \\(60\\% \\) of 80 = \\(0.60 \\times 80 = 48\\)\n   - Third subject: \\(90\\% \\) of 80 = \\(0.90 \\times 80 = 72\\)\n\n   Sum of first three = \\(60 + 48 + 72 = 180\\)\n\n4. Marks in the fourth subject = Total obtained − sum of first three:\n   $$\n   256 - 180 = 76\n   $$\n\nFinal answer: 76 marks out of 80. This matches option (d).\n\n---\n\n## Question C — Simple restatement\nRs. 5300 is split among Anuj, Manuj and Tanuj. Anuj gets 20% more than Manuj. Manuj gets 25% less than Tanuj. How much does Tanuj get?\n\n- Your answer: 2400  \n- Correct answer: 2000\n\n### Why your answer is incorrect\nYou likely mixed up the \"25% less than\" relationship or treated percent increases/decreases incorrectly when forming ratios. These problems are easiest when you express each person's share in terms of one variable and use fractions.\n\n### Step-by-step solution\n1. Let Manuj's amount = \\(M\\).\n\n2. Anuj gets 20% more than Manuj:\n   $$\n   \\text{Anuj} = M + 0.20M = 1.2M = \\frac{6}{5}M\n   $$\n\n3. \"Manuj gets 25% less than Tanuj\" means:\n   $$\n   M = T - 0.25T = 0.75T = \\frac{3}{4}T\n   $$\n   So express \\(T\\) in terms of \\(M\\):\n   $$\n   T = \\frac{M}{0.75} = \\frac{M}{3/4} = \\frac{4}{3}M\n   $$\n\n4. Total sum:\n   $$\n   \\text{Anuj} + \\text{Manuj} + \\text{Tanuj} = \\frac{6}{5}M + M + \\frac{4}{3}M\n   $$\n\n   Convert to a common denominator (15):\n   $$\n   \\frac{18}{15}M + \\frac{15}{15}M + \\frac{20}{15}M = \\frac{53}{15}M\n   $$\n\n5. Given total is 5300, so:\n   $$\n   \\frac{53}{15}M = 5300 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad M = 5300 \\times \\frac{15}{53}\n   $$\n   Note \\(5300 \\div 53 = 100\\). So:\n   $$\n   M = 100 \\times 15 = 1500\n   $$\n\n6. Now find Tanuj:\n   $$\n   T = \\frac{4}{3}M = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 1500 = 2000\n   $$\n\nFinal answer: Tanuj receives Rs. 2000. This matches option (a).\n\n---\n\n## Question D — Simple restatement\nEgg prices went up by 20%. Because of that, for Rs. 200 you can buy 5 fewer eggs than before. What is the new price of one dozen (12) eggs?\n\n- Your answer: Rs. 80  \n- Correct answer: Rs. 96\n\n### Why your answer is incorrect\nYou probably did not set up the relationship between the original and new number of eggs correctly. It's easiest to work with price per egg and use the fact that the number bought = total money ÷ price per egg.\n\n### Step-by-step solution\n1. Let original price per egg = \\(p\\) (in rupees). After a 20% increase, new price per egg = \\(1.2p\\).\n\n2. Number of eggs you could buy for Rs. 200 originally:\n   $$\n   \\frac{200}{p}\n   $$\n\n   After the increase, number you can buy:\n   $$\n   \\frac{200}{1.2p}\n   $$\n\n3. The difference is 5 eggs:\n   $$\n   \\frac{200}{p} - \\frac{200}{1.2p} = 5\n   $$\n\n4. Factor \\(200/p\\):\n   $$\n   \\frac{200}{p}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1.2}\\right) = 5\n   $$\n\n   Compute \\(\\frac{1}{1.2} = \\frac{5}{6}\\). So \\(1 - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\n   Thus:\n   $$\n   \\frac{200}{p} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 5\n   $$\n\n5. Multiply both sides by 6:\n   $$\n   \\frac{200}{p} = 30 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad p = \\frac{200}{30} = \\frac{20}{3} \\text{ rupees per egg}\n   $$\n\n6. New price per egg = \\(1.2p = 1.2 \\times \\frac{20}{3} = 8\\) rupees.\n\n7. Price of a dozen (12 eggs) = \\(12 \\times 8 = 96\\) rupees.\n\nFinal answer: Rs. 96. This matches option (d).\n\n---\n\n## Question E — Simple restatement\nMalini donates 25% of her income. From the remainder she deposits 40% into a bank. After these two actions she is left with Rs. 10,800. What was her original income?\n\n- Your answer: Rs. 20,000  \n- Correct answer: Rs. 24,000\n\n### Why your answer is incorrect\nYou probably misinterpreted \"deposited 40% of the rest\" as depositing 40% of the original income or assumed she was left with only the 40% rather than the remaining 60% of the remaining amount. Careful stepwise reduction avoids that error.\n\n### Step-by-step solution\n1. Let income be \\(I\\).\n\n2. After donating 25%:\n   $$\n   \\text{Remaining} = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75I\n   $$\n\n3. She deposits 40% of this remainder, so the deposited amount is \\(0.40 \\times 0.75I = 0.30I\\).\n\n4. The money she is left with (after donation and deposit) is the remaining part of that remainder, i.e., 60% of the remainder:\n   $$\n   \\text{Left} = 0.60 \\times 0.75I = 0.45I\n   $$\n\n5. Given this left amount is Rs. 10,800:\n   $$\n   0.45I = 10{,}800 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad I = \\frac{10{,}800}{0.45} = 24{,}000\n   $$\n\nFinal answer: Rs. 24,000. This matches option (b).\n\n---\n\n# Concept primer — Percentages and stepwise percentage operations\n\nA compact guide to the ideas used above.\n\n- Converting percent to decimal:\n  - \\(x\\%\\) means \\(\\dfrac{x}{100}\\).  \n    Example: \\(60\\% = 0.6\\), \\(25\\% = 0.25\\).\n\n- Percentage of a number:\n  - \"A% of B\" = \\(\\dfrac{A}{100} \\times B\\).  \n    Example: \\(75\\% \\text{ of } 80 = 0.75 \\times 80 = 60\\).\n\n- Solving linear equations from word statements:\n  - Translate each phrase into algebra. Example:\n    - \"Added to\" = plus, \"divided by\" = fraction,\n    - Then manipulate algebraically (multiply out denominators, isolate variable).\n\n- Percent increase/decrease and ratios:\n  - If B is \\(k\\%\\) more than A, then \\(B = (1 + k/100)A\\).\n  - If A is \\(k\\%\\) less than B, then \\(A = (1 - k/100)B\\) or \\(B = \\dfrac{A}{1 - k/100}\\).\n\n- Successive percentage operations:\n  - When a portion is removed and then a percentage of the rest is taken, apply operations in sequence.\n  - Example: donate 25% then deposit 40% of rest → final left fraction = \\((1-0.25)\\times(1-0.40) = 0.75 \\times 0.6 = 0.45\\) of original.\n\n- Working with money and unit items:\n  - Price per item = total money / number of items.\n  - If price increases, the number you can buy for a fixed amount decreases: set up equations comparing original and new quantities.\n\nUseful small formulas:\n- Overall percent to total marks: Total obtained = (overall% / 100) × total maximum.\n- Convert percent relationships to fractions for exact arithmetic (e.g., 1.2 = 6/5, 0.75 = 3/4, 1/1.2 = 5/6).\n\n---\n\n# Next steps study plan (tailored to your diagnosis)\n\nYou have good listening skills and grasp the straightforward ideas. To improve retention and application on moderate problems, follow this plan for two weeks:\n\n1. Daily short practice (30–45 minutes):\n   - Day 1–7: Do 8 moderate percent problems each day (mix of donation/deposit, price increase, average percent problems).\n   - Day 8–14: Increase to 10 problems, include at least 2 slightly harder multi-step problems.\n\n2. Focused drills:\n   - Flashcards (10 mins daily): write down common percent conversions and fraction equivalents (e.g., 20% = 1/5, 25% = 1/4, 12.5% = 1/8).\n   - Quick ratio conversions: practice expressing “X% more/less” as multipliers (e.g., 20% more = ×1.2).\n\n3. Error analysis (10–15 mins after practice):\n   - For every wrong answer, write the correct solution in 3 small steps. This reinforces memory and application.\n\n4. Mixed review twice a week with a peer or tutor:\n   - Explain 2 solved problems aloud—teaching helps retention.\n\n5. Weekly timed quiz:\n   - 20 minutes, 15 mixed problems. Focus on accuracy, then review errors.\n\n6. Strengthen arithmetic:\n   - If calculation slips cause errors, practice mental arithmetic shortcuts and fraction-decimal conversions for 10 minutes/day.\n\nYou’re close — just keep practicing multi-step setups carefully, always convert percents to decimals or fractions first, and write every intermediate arithmetic step. That will reduce careless errors and build lasting understanding. Keep up the good work!"
