  "tutor_notes": "# Review of your Wrong Questions â€” Clear Explanations and Step-by-Step Solutions\n\nYou're doing well with basic percent ideas. Below I walk through each wrong question, show what you answered vs the correct choice, explain why the error happened, and solve it step-by-step so the reasoning is clear. Stay encouraged â€” these are fixable mistakes.\n\n---\n\n## Question 1 â€” Restated\nCompare: \"What is equal to 60% of 264?\"\n\n- Student's answer: a) 10% of 44  \n- Correct answer: b) 15% of 1056\n\n### Why your answer is incorrect\nYou picked option (a). That would be much too small â€” 10% of 44 is 4.4, but 60% of 264 is far larger. Likely a scaling or conversion error.\n\n### Step-by-step solution\n1. Compute 60% of 264:\n   $$\n   60\\% \\text{ of }264 = 0.60\\times 264 = 264\\times\\frac{60}{100}\n   $$\n2. Multiply:\n   $$\n   264\\times 0.6 = 264\\times\\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{264\\times6}{10} = \\frac{1584}{10} = 158.4\n   $$\n3. Evaluate option (b): 15% of 1056:\n   $$\n   15\\% \\text{ of }1056 = 0.15\\times 1056 = 1056\\times\\frac{15}{100}\n   $$\n   $$\n   = 1056\\times 0.1 + 1056\\times 0.05 = 105.6 + 52.8 = 158.4\n   $$\n4. Since both equal $158.4$, option (b) is correct.\n\nFinal: 60% of 264 = 158.4, which equals 15% of 1056 â†’ answer (b).\n\n---\n\n## Question 2 â€” Restated\n\"What must be added to 40% of 900 to make the total equal to 30% of 2600?\"\n\n- Student's answer: b) 360  \n- Correct answer: c) 420\n\n### Why your answer is incorrect\nYou answered 360, which is actually 40% of 900 itself. You likely thought no extra amount was needed or subtracted incorrectly.\n\n### Step-by-step solution\n1. Compute 40% of 900:\n   $$\n   40\\% \\text{ of }900 = 0.4\\times900 = 360\n   $$\n2. Compute 30% of 2600:\n   $$\n   30\\% \\text{ of }2600 = 0.3\\times2600 = 780\n   $$\n3. Let $x$ be what must be added. Then:\n   $$\n   360 + x = 780\n   $$\n4. Solve for $x$:\n   $$\n   x = 780 - 360 = 420\n   $$\nFinal: You must add 420 â†’ answer (c).\n\n---\n\n## Question 3 â€” Restated\n\"Rs. 5300 is split among Anuj, Manuj and Tanuj. Anuj gets 20% more than Manuj. Manuj gets 25% less than Tanuj. How much does Tanuj get?\"\n\n- Student's answer: b) 2400  \n- Correct answer: a) 2000\n\n### Why your answer is incorrect\nThis problem needs careful conversion of \"20% more\" and \"25% less\" into multiplication factors. A common error is reversing \"25% less\" (it means multiply by 0.75, not 1.25) or treating percentages as additive incorrectly.\n\n### Step-by-step solution\n1. Let Manuj = $M$. Then:\n   - Anuj $= A = M + 20\\% \\text{ of }M = 1.2M$\n   - \"Manuj gets 25% less than Tanuj\" means $M = T - 25\\% \\text{ of }T = 0.75T$\n     so $T = \\dfrac{M}{0.75} = \\dfrac{4}{3}M$\n2. Sum of all three:\n   $$\n   A + M + T = 1.2M + M + \\frac{4}{3}M\n   $$\n3. Convert to fractions for exact arithmetic:\n   $$\n   1.2M = \\frac{6}{5}M,\\quad M = \\frac{5}{5}M,\\quad \\frac{4}{3}M\n   $$\n   Add:\n   $$\n   \\frac{6}{5}M + \\frac{5}{5}M + \\frac{4}{3}M = \\left(\\frac{18}{15} + \\frac{15}{15} + \\frac{20}{15}\\right)M = \\frac{53}{15}M\n   $$\n4. This total equals Rs. 5300:\n   $$\n   \\frac{53}{15}M = 5300\n   $$\n5. Solve for $M$:\n   $$\n   M = 5300\\times\\frac{15}{53} = 100\\times15 = 1500\n   $$\n   (because $5300/53 = 100$)\n6. Then Tanuj:\n   $$\n   T = \\frac{4}{3}M = \\frac{4}{3}\\times 1500 = 4\\times500 = 2000\n   $$\nFinal: Tanuj receives Rs. 2000 â†’ answer (a).\n\n---\n\n## Question 4 â€” Restated\n\"When 80 is added to 80% of a number, the result equals the number itself. What is 50% of that number?\"\n\n- Student's answer: b) 210  \n- Correct answer: a) 200\n\n### Why your answer is incorrect\nYou likely solved the equation incorrectly or computed the percent step wrong.\n\n### Step-by-step solution\n1. Let the number be $x$. The sentence translates to:\n   $$\n   80\\% \\text{ of }x + 80 = x\n   $$\n   i.e.\n   $$\n   0.8x + 80 = x\n   $$\n2. Subtract $0.8x$ from both sides:\n   $$\n   80 = x - 0.8x = 0.2x\n   $$\n3. Solve for $x$:\n   $$\n   x = \\frac{80}{0.2} = 80\\times 5 = 400\n   $$\n4. Find 50% of $x$:\n   $$\n   50\\% \\text{ of }400 = 0.5\\times400 = 200\n   $$\nFinal: 50% of the number is 200 â†’ answer (a).\n\n---\n\n## Question 5 â€” Restated\n\"A has twice as much money as B. B has 50% more than C. The average money of the three is Rs. 12,100. How much does A have?\"\n\n- Student's answer: a) Rs. 12,500  \n- Correct answer: d) Rs. 19,800\n\n### Why your answer is incorrect\nThis is a chain relationship; a common mistake is mixing up \"50% more than C\" or miscomputing the average. You may have used the average incorrectly or set ratios the wrong way.\n\n### Step-by-step solution\n1. Let C have $c$ rupees.\n2. Then B has 50% more than C:\n   $$\n   B = c + 50\\%\\text{ of }c = 1.5c = \\frac{3}{2}c\n   $$\n3. A has twice as much as B:\n   $$\n   A = 2B = 2\\left(\\frac{3}{2}c\\right) = 3c\n   $$\n4. Total money of all three:\n   $$\n   A + B + C = 3c + \\frac{3}{2}c + c = \\left(3 + 1.5 + 1\\right)c = 5.5c = \\frac{11}{2}c\n   $$\n5. Average of three = total / 3:\n   $$\n   \\text{Average} = \\frac{\\frac{11}{2}c}{3} = \\frac{11}{6}c\n   $$\n   Given average is Rs. 12,100, so:\n   $$\n   \\frac{11}{6}c = 12100\n   $$\n6. Solve for $c$:\n   $$\n   c = 12100\\times\\frac{6}{11} = 1100\\times 6 = 6600\n   $$\n   (since $12100/11 = 1100$)\n7. Now A = $3c = 3\\times 6600 = 19800$.\n\nFinal: A has Rs. 19,800 â†’ answer (d).\n\n---\n\n## Question 6 â€” Restated\n\"If 25% of A is added to 50% of B, the result equals 90% of B. What percentage of A is B?\" (i.e., B as percent of A)\n\n- Student's answer: c) 50  \n- Correct answer: d) 62.50\n\n### Why your answer is incorrect\nYou likely swapped A and B or solved the equation incorrectly. Carefully translate the percentages into algebra.\n\n### Step-by-step solution\n1. Translate sentence to equation:\n   $$\n   25\\% \\text{ of }A + 50\\% \\text{ of }B = 90\\% \\text{ of }B\n   $$\n   i.e.\n   $$\n   0.25A + 0.5B = 0.9B\n   $$\n2. Move the $0.5B$ term to right:\n   $$\n   0.25A = 0.9B - 0.5B = 0.4B\n   $$\n3. Solve for $A$ in terms of $B$:\n   $$\n   A = \\frac{0.4}{0.25}B = \\frac{40}{25}B = \\frac{8}{5}B = 1.6B\n   $$\n4. We want \"What percentage of A is B?\" So find $B$ as a fraction of $A$:\n   $$\n   B = \\frac{A}{1.6} = \\frac{A}{\\frac{8}{5}} = \\frac{5}{8}A\n   $$\n5. Convert fraction to percentage:\n   $$\n   \\frac{5}{8} = 0.625 = 62.5\\%\n   $$\nFinal: B is 62.50% of A â†’ answer (d).\n\n---\n\n# Concept Primer â€” Percentages (quick reference)\n\n- Basic conversion:\n  - $x\\% = \\dfrac{x}{100}$ as a decimal or fraction.\n  - $x\\% \\text{ of } y = \\dfrac{x}{100}\\times y$.\n- Percent increase / decrease:\n  - \"a% more than $P$\" â†’ multiply by $(1 + \\frac{a}{100})$.\n  - \"a% less than $P$\" â†’ multiply by $(1 - \\frac{a}{100})$.\n    - Example: 25% less than $T$ is $0.75T$.\n- Setting up equations:\n  - Translate sentences directly into algebra before arithmetic.\n  - Use consistent variables: pick one variable and express all others in terms of it.\n- Ratios from percent relationships:\n  - If $X$ is $k$ times $Y$, then $X = kY$. To find \"what percent of $X$ is $Y$\", compute $\\frac{Y}{X}\\times100\\%$.\n- Working with averages:\n  - Average of $n$ numbers = (sum of numbers) / $n$.\n  - If you know the average and $n$, you can find the total: total = average $\\times n$.\n\nUseful conversions:\n- 50% = 1/2 = 0.5\n- 25% = 1/4 = 0.25\n- 20% = 1/5 = 0.2\n- 10% = 1/10 = 0.1\n- 62.5% = 5/8 = 0.625\n\n---\n\n# Short Next-Steps Study Plan (tailored to your diagnosis)\n\nYou have a solid foundation. The errors are from multi-step setups and percentage interpretation. Follow this plan over the next 2â€“3 weeks.\n\n1. Daily practice (25â€“30 minutes):\n   - 10 minutes: Quick percent conversions and flashcards (e.g., convert 37.5%, 12.5%, 62.5%).\n   - 15â€“20 minutes: 6â€“8 mixed problems with increasing steps (include percent of numbers, percent change, chained relationships).\n2. Focus topics (each session pick one):\n   - Translating word problems into equations (practice 5 problems).\n   - Percent increase/decrease and \"more/less than\" conversions.\n   - Ratio chains (like A related to B, B related to C).\n   - Average problems involving ratios.\n3. Mistake log:\n   - For every wrong question, write one sentence describing the mistake (e.g., \"I treated 25% less as subtract 25 from the number instead of multiply by 0.75\").\n   - Re-solve the problem correctly immediately.\n4. Weekly check (once per week):\n   - Timed set of 15 mixed percent problems to track improvement.\n   - Focus on accuracy first, then time.\n5. Resources:\n   - Short topic videos (5â€“10 minutes) on percent increase/decrease and ratio chaining.\n   - Practice worksheets that escalate from 1-step to 3-step percentage equations.\n\nKeep practicing the translation from words to equations â€” that's where most of these mistakes originate. You're close; with targeted practice you'll confidently handle multi-step percent problems. Great effort â€” keep it up!"
